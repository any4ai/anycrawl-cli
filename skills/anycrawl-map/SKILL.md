# anycrawl map

Discover URLs on a site. Essential when the user knows which site but not which exact page.

## When to use

- You need to find a specific subpage on a large site
- You want a list of all URLs on a site before scraping or crawling
- Step 3 in the [workflow escalation pattern](../anycrawl-cli/SKILL.md): search → scrape → **map** → crawl

## Quick start

```bash
# Get all URLs from a site
anycrawl map "https://example.com" -o .anycrawl/urls.txt

# JSON output with limit
anycrawl map "https://example.com" --limit 500 --json -o .anycrawl/urls.json

# Include subdomains
anycrawl map "https://example.com" --include-subdomains -o .anycrawl/urls.txt
```

## Options

| Option                    | Description                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `--limit <n>`             | Max URLs to return (1-50000) |
| `--include-subdomains`    | Include subdomain URLs       |
| `--ignore-sitemap`        | Skip sitemap parsing         |
| `--use-index`             | Use page cache index (default: true) |
| `-o, --output <path>`     | Output file path             |
| `--json`                  | Output as JSON               |

## Tips

- **Map + scrape is a common pattern**: use `map` to find URLs, then `scrape` the ones you need.
