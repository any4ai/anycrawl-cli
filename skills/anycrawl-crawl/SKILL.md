# anycrawl crawl

Bulk extract content from a website. Crawls pages following links up to a depth/limit.

## When to use

- You need content from many pages on a site (e.g., all `/docs/`)
- You want to extract an entire site section
- Step 4 in the [workflow escalation pattern](../anycrawl-cli/SKILL.md): search → scrape → map → **crawl**

## Quick start

```bash
# Crawl and wait for completion
anycrawl crawl "https://example.com" --wait -o .anycrawl/crawl.json

# With progress indicator
anycrawl crawl "https://example.com" --wait --progress -o .anycrawl/crawl.json

# Limit pages and scope
anycrawl crawl "https://example.com" --include-paths /docs --limit 50 --wait -o .anycrawl/crawl.json

# Check status of a running crawl
anycrawl crawl <job-id>

# Cancel a crawl
anycrawl crawl cancel <job-id>
```

| `--strategy`              | Crawl strategy                              |

## Tips

- Always use `--wait` when you need the results immediately. Without it, crawl returns a job ID for async polling.
- Use `--include-paths` to scope the crawl — don't crawl an entire site when you only need one section.
